HANDIN 2 (palindrome)

This handin is done by:

    201706079 Hans Br√ºner Dein

Reflection upon solution:

    
Initially I used the string.ascii_letters package from the previous handin to 
make a list of strings based on ascii letters, but since i wanted 
capital letters first i just defined my own string. It can only create 56 labels,
but that should be plenty for this assignment. 

For part b I made a for loop where I just deleted the chosen items to avoid double counting. 
I found this easier than checking if a number had already been selected. 
The downside is that this would be difficult to implement using list comprehension.

for c I first made a for-loop as a test, then i made a much simpler function 
using list comprehension. And the I made an even simpler function.

For d I basically replicated my function from c, except I removed the if statement
and made the second variable be selected from pairs(B)
